To change which port the server is listening to, I uncommented the line on the sshd_config file under etc/sshd and changed the port from 22 to 22345.
I disabled reverse DNS lookup by also uncommenting the noDNS line in the same file and setting it to "no".
While I was there, I also uncommented the SSH related lines, namely "authorized keys" (to provide an ssh key file for ssh login) and also the "allow password login" line in case ssh were to fail at some point.

To get SSH to work, I also disabled ssh.socket, which was the faster of the two options.

I then reloaded the daemon.
