I'm not sure that the commit message I set for most of my commits so far were descriptive enough, so just in case, here are the explanations for the exercises done so far:


- LOCALE: I just modified the /etc/default/locale file to suit my needs.


- BACKUP: I created a few scripts: backup.sh, to create a copy under /var/backup/inotify/ of any file it's given; incron_config, which triggers the backup.sh script whenever any file under /etc is modified; and then I set up a script on my own machine to
          make a backup of all of /etc 5 minutes after I boot up my laptop. Finally, cleanup_yoda.sh removes all files from the yoda/ directory so backup functionality can be validated. I used cron and incron to automate the triggering of each script.


- SUDO: I opened the sudoers file and added a few commands to allow the check user to execute a few commands as sudo without password verification.


- APT: I set up unattended-upgrades so that any new upgrades are automatically installed without me having to do it manually.
